#Think of variables as containers for storing data.
#In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable . PHP is a Loosely Typed Language, here no need to declare variables:
#The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.



<?php
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;

echo  $txt ;
?>
