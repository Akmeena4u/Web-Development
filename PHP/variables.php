#Think of variables as containers for storing data.
#In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable . PHP is a Loosely Typed Language, here no need to declare variables:
#The PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.




<?php
// Variables are containers for storing information
// Starts with a $
$name = "Shubham";
// Variables are case sensitive
$namE = "Capital wala Shubham";
$income = 200.8;

echo "This guy is $name and his income is Rs. $income<br>";

echo "$namE is a good boy<br>";
echo "$name is the real gangsta<br>";


?>
