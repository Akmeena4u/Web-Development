/* ****Introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript & How websites work? | Web Development Tutorials****

Now let us first understand what HTML, CSS, and Javascript are for? For every website to be designed, 
HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is a must. This is the skeleton of a website. Without it, no website can run. 
CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**) adds beauty to that website and JavaScript adds the brain to allow the functioning of that website.
Therefore, CSS and JavaScript add beauty and brain to a particular website respectively.

Let us now take another example of a car. The HTML acts as the metallic body of a car and the CSS acts as the color and design of the car.
Finally, the engine of a car is like the JavaScript on the website to add functionality

the Internet was born by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1969 and was initially called As ARPANET       

Lot of guys think  internet as a complex cloud of informations but it is not exactly like that 
it is a wired network in worldwide. and all computers are connected through this. few computers have a special that need to be available for 27*7 that are known as servers.
so when a user's computer requests a site from his browser firstly request will go to an internet provider that in India may be airtel, jio and vi, etc.
from there our request will go to DNS server, DNS server is like a phone call log , this will send IP address according to our requested site  after searching in his database,
for google it will be 216.58.210.46 so now u got exact ip address so now u will send a direct request to the internet backbone via isp
then our request will go to that website's server where that is hosted and finally we will get our requested answer in mili seconds
